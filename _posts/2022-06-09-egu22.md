During the 2022 EGU General Assembly I was able to (virtually...) present the results from my first year (and a half...) of PhD.\\

The work I talked about revolves around the idea of reconstructing the ground shaking maps for an area in real-time using sparse data (i.e., the values of the ground motion parameter recorded at each seismic station).
This work can have real applicability in a monitoring environment, complementing traditional methods which rely on ground motion predictions equations and thus require information about the magnitude and location of the event, which are slow to compute: the Italian Department of Civil Protection gets these information (manually revised by INGV operators) on average 12 minutes after an event; on the other hand, the data from the stations are available with a delay of just a few seconds since the data have been  recorded.\\
The station information available in real-time are exploited using a machine learning approach that provides robust results in real-time: despite the hardware at DMG seeming to be the bottleneck, an updated ground shaking map is available every few seconds using the data from the whole Italian accelerometric network (RAN)!
