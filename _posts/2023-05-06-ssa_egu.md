April has been conference time with SSA 2023 Annual Meeting and EGU 2023 General Assembly on back to back weeks.\\
It has been the occasion to gain new insight and get new ideas for future projects.\\
At both conferences I presented the recent development to ShakeRec targeted to improve output resolution, uncertainty estimates, and interpretability of the model, all wrapped in a hybrid model to be integrated in the ShakeMap workflow.\\

During EGU23 I was honored to receive the EGU 2022 OSPP award from (now former) EGU SM division president Philippe Jousset. It would not been possible without Veronica Pazzi and Giovanni Costa: this award is really the result of a team effort.
