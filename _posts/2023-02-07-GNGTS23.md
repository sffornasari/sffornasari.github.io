At the (41st) GNGTS 2023 (and the 3rd young researchers AGLC workshop) I presented the results of the application of [ShakeRec](https://doi.org/10.1785/0120220034) to the Bargagli and Costa MArchigiano Pesarese earthquakes.\\
The two scenarios considered provide an overview of the capabilities and the limits of ShakeRec as a seismic monitoring tool.\\
